# New Platypus OS Drafts
New OS drafts, I stopped the old one :(
<br/><br/>
Chat about development on [Discord](https://discord.gg/t6keJw974q)!

# What this is for
I want it to be for:
1. Programming
2. Pentesting
3. Playing video games

Seems like an odd combination, but that's what I like to do: program, pentest, and play video games.

# Building
