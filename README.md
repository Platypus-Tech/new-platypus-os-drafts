# Platypus OS
New OS drafts, I stopped the old one :(

# What this is for
I want it to be for:
1. Programming
2. Pentesting
3. Playing video games

Seems like an odd combination, but that's what I like to do: program, pentest, and play video games.

# Building
To build the OS, read the [build guide](docs/Building.md).
